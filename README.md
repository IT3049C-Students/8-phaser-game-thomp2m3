### How long it took me to finish this?

This assignment took me about 2 hours to complete.  I followed a game tutorial found on phaser.io and obtained the pictures and json file for the assets there as well.  It was really fun to play around more with the phaser engine, see a new syntax to declare.  I feel like I could've challenged myself a bit more to add some creativity.
